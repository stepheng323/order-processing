**Load Balancer and API Gateway:**

The Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple API Gateway instances. This setup ensures high availability and helps to prevent any single point of failure. The API Gateway is the entry point for client requests, handling tasks like request routing.

**Security Layer:** This layer is crucial for protecting the system. It handles:

**Authentication:** Verifying the identity of users or services making requests.
Authorization: Determining if the authenticated entity has the right to perform the requested action.
Data Encryption: Ensuring sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
Rate Limiting: Protecting against DDoS attacks by limiting the number of requests from a single source.


**Order Service Cluster:**

This is a group of Order Service instances that can be scaled horizontally to handle increased load. Each instance is capable of processing orders independently. The cluster design allows for:


**High Availability:**

If one instance fails, others can continue to handle requests.
Load Distribution: Incoming requests are distributed across all available instances.
Easier Maintenance: Instances can be updated or replaced without downtime.


**Distributed Cache:**

The cache (e.g., Redis or Memcached) stores frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times. we might store:

User session data
Product information
Partially completed orders
The "Check Cache" step in the flow is important for performance optimization, reducing overhead of querying the database everytime

**Order Database:**

We go with a relational database (e.g. PostgreSQL) optimized for ACID transactions. It stores all order-related data, including:

Order details

Customer information

Order status

Payment information

**Message Broker:**
The Message Broker (e.g., Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ) is central to this architecture. It allows:

Decoupling of services: Services can communicate without direct dependencies.
Asynchronous processing: Services can process events at their own pace


**Monitoring & Autoscaling:**
Here we continuously monitor the performance and health of the Order Service Cluster. It can:


Collect metrics on CPU usage, memory consumption, request latency, etc.
